    "# Research Question: We want to have a broader understanding of traffic collisions in the City of LA. \n",
    "# In the City of Los Angeles, what do the traffic collisions look like in 2020, and how do they compare to 2010? \n",
    "# With this project, we hope to understand the demographics and conditions of neighborhoods in Los Angeles with a particular focus on infrastructure, \n",
    "# like road safety and signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Other things we are thinking about: \n",
    "# - Materials of road\n",
    "# - Commute time\n",
    "# - Time of day of collision\n",
    "# - Comparing areas and regions within greater Los Angeles \n",
    "# - Substance Abuse\n",
    "# - MO Codes\n",
    "# - Demographic characteristics of dataset\n",

    "# An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake:\n",
    "# We care about this research question because as burgeoning urban planners who go to school in West LA, \n",
    "# traffic collisions in West LA are both specific instances and a specific geography that we think about frequently. \n",
    "# Traffic collisions are a symptom of larger problems including a cityâ€™s overreliance on cars and car infrastructure, \n",
    "# and poor and unsafe pedestrian infrastructure. Vehicle traffic collisions are one of the leading causes of unintentional \n",
    "# injuries in the United States. We hypothesize that vehicle traffic collisions are not equal across racial and socioeconomic demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# This research question is vital to address because it can help us as planners, to make informed decisions about improving road layouts such as signs,\n",
    "# traffic flow, and road safety to ensure the well being of residents, commuters, and pedestrians. At stake is not only the lives of LA residents, commuters, \n",
    "# tourists but also the economic losses through the health sector and insurance claims.\n",
