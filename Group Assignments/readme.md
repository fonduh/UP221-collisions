**Research Question:**
We want to understand which streets and intersections in West Los Angeles had the most traffic collisions in 2018, and why? With this project, we hope to understand the demographics and conditions of neighborhoods in West LA with a particular focus on infrastructure, like road safety and signs.

**An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake:** 
 
We care about this research question because as burgeoning urban planners who go to school in West LA, traffic collisions in West LA are both specific instances and a specific geography that we think about frequently. Traffic collisions are a symptom of larger problems including a city’s overreliance on cars and car infrastructure, and poor and unsafe pedestrian infrastructure. Vehicle traffic collisions are one of the leading causes of unintentional injuries in the United States. We hypothesize that vehicle traffic collisions are not equal across racial and socioeconomic demographics. 

This research question is vital to address because it can help us as planners, to make informed decisions about improving road layouts such as signs, traffic flow, and road safety to ensure the well being of residents, commuters, and pedestrians. At stake is not only the lives of LA residents, commuters, tourists but also the economic losses through the health sector and insurance claims.

**Spatial Scope:** We’re going to narrow our scope to traffic collisions in West LA. [If this scope is too small, then we can compare West LA to Central LA.] We’ll be looking at the census data in order to understand the demographic makeup of West LA and population density.

**Scope:** We intend to explore social and temporal factors contributing to accidents such as alcohol consumption, time of day, daylight savings, annual holiday crashes, driver’s age etc. We also hope to explore data that might be contributing to an increase in accidents such as traffic congestion, population density, infrastructure, and/or weather. 

**Insights:** In visually representing this data, we hope to identify any factors that contribute to increased traffic accidents. We’re most excited for the opportunity to showcase our coding skills in this report, and potentially identify areas where more infrastructure is needed in West LA.
